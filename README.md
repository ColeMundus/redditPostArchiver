## Motivation ##

If you're addicted to reddit, then it's pretty likely stemming from the fact that it changed the way you live your life (or a part of it at least). Contained within their databases lies a huge treasure trove of information: academic, creative, informative, transformative, etc. It's true that a huge amount of the information that is accessible through reddit 

* Some future SOPA spin-off could limit the content of the internet, and perhaps make reddit delete old posts. 
* Although it seems unthinkable now, the popularity of reddit could possibly wane (a similar but clearly superior alternative, for example). Waning popularity translates into waning revenues, which might impact their data retention strategy -- older post might simply be deleted after reaching a certain age.
